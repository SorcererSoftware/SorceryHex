SorceryHex
==========

Custom Hex Editor

SorceryHex is a concept for a smarter, more capable hex editor.
Unlike alternative hex editors, it provide smart interpretations and editing tools to match your data's format.
Unlike alternative data-specific editors, it gives you a full view of your data and lets you control every aspect of your data.

It is in the concept phase, and only works for .gba files (ROM files for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance).

# Current controls:
Ctrl+I: Open the interpreter, a panel that guesses at the meaning of the data onscreen.
Ctrl+Click: Follow a pointer, or return to a pointer source.
Ctrl+Left/Right: Shift the data alignment left/right.
Resize: Change the bytes per line.
